Project Title: Draw 112!


Project Description: 
There are two sides to this amazing drawing app: an artist’s palette and a game! In drawing mode, the artist can freely draw by choosing from various color options, line thicknesses, and shapes. The shapes are created with keyboard shortcuts - ‘r’ for rectangle, ‘c’ for circle, ‘p’ for regular polygon, ‘l’ for line, and ‘s’ for scribble mode. The user can also choose a color themselves if they choose to - they do this by clicking the ‘RGB’ button and then following the prompts in the console that ask for the red, green, and blue values in 3-digit numbers. The ‘bold’ button yields a shape with thick lines, ‘med’ will give medium lines, and ‘ thin’ will give thin lines. There’s also a button to choose the thickness using a slider. You draw shapes/lines by clicking the color and thickness mode and then using the key shortcuts to activate a shape/line. 
Pressing ‘g’ will switch to game mode! There will be a screen with basic instructions, and you will press ‘b’ to begin the game. The artist will be given a word after the guesser is told to look away by the screen prompt. The artist will then be given a chance to guess what the artist is drawing - when the guesser thinks they know the word, they can press ‘w’ on the keyboard to activate guess mode, stopping the artist from drawing and temporarily pausing the timer. The guesser can then go to the console and type their guess - if correct, they win. If wrong, they get another chance or can exit guess mode. The guess counter will increment for each guess, and the word counter will increment when the right word is guessed. If the right word is guessed, the option is given to continue into a new round while keeping the current guess count and word count or exit game mode altogether. 
Colorblindness Mode (changes app color scheme to colorblind-friendly color) and Read Aloud (text to speech on instructions) contribute to the bandwidth of the app - they are for the social good!


Run Instructions: 
1. Make sure to download these modules - cmu_graphics, random, pyautogui, os, pyttsx3 - and have them in the same file as the draw112.py file
2. Open the draw112.py file
3. Run the draw112.py file - all code is within this file.


Shortcut Commands: N/A 
There are several keyboard shortcuts in my game but they are not primarily for testing purposes - they're part of the actual functionality. You can find a list of these keyboard shortcuts by running the draw112.py file and pressing ‘ q’ - this will open a popup with a list of all keyboard shortcuts.
